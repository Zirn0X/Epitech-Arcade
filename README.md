# Arcade

Arcade is a project that consists in recreating an arcade terminal that can be managed by several graphic libraries

## How does it work?

Concerning the functioning of this project, we have imagined a common architecture that will allow us to manage several graphic libraries at the same time.
This allows us to change game at any time and also graphic library.

## Getting Started

### Installation

- [sdl2](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/rust-programming-by/9781788390637/386c15eb-41b2-41b4-bd65-154a750a58d8.xhtml)
- [sfml](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php)
- [ncurses](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-install-ncurses-library-headers-on-debian-ubuntu-centos-fedora/)

### Quickstart

First compile the code
```cmd
make
```
then you can run the projet by choose one graphical library at the beginning:
```cmd
./arcade lib/arcade_ncurses.so
```

### Usage
Once you are in game, first you going to be in the menu and you will be able to choose one game and one graphical library to run first.

Here's the keys to play:
- Left arrow : Go left.
- Right arrow : Go right.
- Up arrow : Go up.
- Down arrow : Go down.
- G : Previous graphical library.
- H : Next graphical library.
